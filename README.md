# Demo

Here's what it looks like in its current state

# Ideas

- [ ] Leaderboard per-level
- [ ] Leaderboard for total turns remaining summation golf
- [ ] Stars per level based on how well they do

## Level ideas

Should consider accessibility and write letters or some symbol on tiles to differentiate. 

- [ ] Basic level or two that introduce concepts with little popups as you hit waypoints
- [x] Full ice map with obstacles that stop you from sliding
- [x] Maze with stationary obstacles
- [ ] Maze with moving obstacles
- [ ] Bigger wall moving level that continues to move towards you
- [x] Different all ice puzzles, or mostly ice
- [ ] enemy is blocked away from you and moving it like in x direction causes it to eventually come closer in y direction

## Mechanic ideas

- [x] Snake
   - You leave behind a trail and hitting own trail makes you lose level
- [ ] Double colored tiles
   - Like two green tiles and when you hit one, you get a green snake trail, then when you hit the other it stops but persists. Then you hit one of the two red tiles and get a red trail, then hit the second one. If you hit an already painted tile, you lose
- [x] Static terrain
- [ ] Dynamic terrain
  - [x] Objects that move on a schedule and can move you around the map
  - [ ] Some levels require usage of those moving objects to push you to complete in level limit
- [ ] Enemy chase
  - [x] Every time you move, enemy moves or tries to block you
  - [ ] Can use terrain to reroute them
  - [x] Can hit certain tiles to disable them
- [ ] Irrelevant colors
- [ ] Wall (similar to dynamic terrain?)
  - This theoretical level has a wall, and rotating the wall into view adds a certain mechanic that aids/allows you to complete the level - Evan Lane (all royalties are awarded to Evan Lane)
- [ ] Off the grid
  - end up on diagonal grid
- [x] Ice
  - Tiles that make you slide until you hit end of ice path
- [ ] Traps
  - Tiles that knock you away from next waypoint or something
- [ ] Portal
  - Tiles that teleport you across the map, think going from one corner to another in the board game Clue
- [ ] Tiles below map, you have to go hit one beneath map
- [ ] Moveable object that you can push onto ice and such

## Meta ideas

- [ ] Shoes on wrong foot
- [ ] Don't judge a book by its cover
  - Irrelevant title page

I added some notes into the help section below if OmniSharp is being a pain (more of a note for myself since I'm new to Unity).

## OmniSharp givin' ya trouble?
If OmniSharp is being a pain, then it's possible that it's loading a .sln file that's incorrect, and therefore not discovering your .csproj files. When OmniSharp starts up, check the log and ensure it's loading the root .sln file.

If there's no root .sln file, go into Unity->Edit->Preferences, then ensure that your External Script Editor is set to VSCode, and you can "Regenerate Project Files" without any boxes ticked
